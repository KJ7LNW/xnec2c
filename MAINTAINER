Neoklis has asked me to take over maintenance of xnec2c, so github will
its permanent home.  Please send me patches and pull-requests if you
have anything to contribute on this project.  Thanks!

Background:

I had asked Neoklis for help integrating an external Simplex optimizer
some time last year.  In the process of that project Neoklis added
support for multiple FR cards and I added multi-plot support for each
frequency range.  We also added accelerated linear algebra libraries as
of that refactor.

Here is the original discussion with Neoklis that led to my taking over
as maintainer:

Well, I think it is an extensive modification but anyhow, its the matter of
maintenance of the code - since you made all these changes I think it will
be difficult for me to maintain the code. I am sort of winding down my 
activities in programming in any case and I may not be able to deal with
bug reports. Also, the documentation will need to be updated with info
for the user and a new version number in the history.

I could put it on my website but it would be better if you set it up on Github
as your own development of xnec2c.  The same thing is happening with
glrpt, a Russian programmer is developing a very modified version on Github.
